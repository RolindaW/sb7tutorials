- Core profile vs. Compatibility profile

	OpenGL specification is "forked" into to profiles.
	Core profile: Modern; Removes a number of legacy features, leaving only those that are truly accelerated by current graphics hardware.
	Compatibility profile: Maintains backward compatibility with all revisions of OpenGL back to version 1.0.

- Degenerate primitive

	A line with zero length or a triangle with zero area (have to or more vertices in the exact same place). OpenGL discards (degenerate) this type of primitive.
