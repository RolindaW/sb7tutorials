- C-like language

	Similar syntax and model.
	Suited for graphics (vector and matrix types are built into the language) and parallel execution (designed to run on massively parallel implementations - shader invocations).
	Exception not support.
	Function overloading support.

- Data types

	Scalar
	
		bool: true / false
		float: single-precision floating point number (32 bit).
		double: double-precision floating point number (64 bit).
		int: signed integer (32 bit - 1 bit for sign; [- 2 147 483 648, 2 147 483 647]). Wrap if overflow.
		uint: unsigned integer (32 bit; [0, 4 294 967 295]). Wrap if overflow.
	
	Vector
	
		As an array.
		By size: vec2, vec3, and vec4.
		Support all scalar types; require name decorator - prefix - if not float (bool - b; double - d; int - i; uint - u) e.g. bvec2, dvec2, ivec2, or uvec2.
		Access: by index (array-like) vs. by component (xyzw; rgba; stpq) - allow swizzling.
		Operations
		
			Vector-Scalar: multiplication (*), and division (/).
			Vector-Vector: addition (+), substraction (-), multiplication (component-wise), and division (component-wise).
	
	Matrix
	
		As an array of vectors (columns) or two-dimensional array.
		By size: (square) mat2, mat3, and mat4; (non-square) mat2x3, mat2x4, mat3x2, mat3x4, mat4x2, and mat4x3.
		Support only floating point scalar types e.g. dmat2, dmat3x4, or dmat4x2.
		Access: first component only by index; second component like a vector.
		Operations
		
			Matrix-Scalar: multiplication, and division.
			Matrix-Vector: multiplication.
			Vector-Vector: addition, substraction, multiplication, and division (component-wise).
	
	Structure
	
		Syntax: "struct structure_name { ... };"
		Support (as field) all scalar types, all vector and matrix types, other structures, and arrays (of any type).
		Access by component (field).
	
	Array
	
		Syntax: "element_type var_name[var_size];" vs. "element_type[var_size] var_name;" (allow implicit type - usable as return value in a function - and its constructor definition)
		Special method (member function): ".length
		Support (as element type) all scalar types, all vector and matrix types, other structures, and arrays (not official support for multidimensional array).
		Access by index.
		
	Other opaque data types: represent other data structures (e.g. sampler / image for textures).
