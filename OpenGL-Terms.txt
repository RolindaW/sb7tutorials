- Core profile vs. Compatibility profile

	OpenGL specification is "forked" into to profiles.
	Core profile: Modern; Removes a number of legacy features, leaving only those that are truly accelerated by current graphics hardware.
	Compatibility profile: Maintains backward compatibility with all revisions of OpenGL back to version 1.0.

- Degenerate primitive

	A line with zero length or a triangle with zero area (have to or more vertices in the exact same place). OpenGL discards (degenerate) this type of primitive.
	
- Fixed-function stage (block) vs. Programmable shader stage

	Fixed-function stage: Non-programmable stage of the rendering pipeline. Can be (slightly) customized setting up built-in variables of the pipeline.
	Programmable shader stage: Programmable stage of the rendering pipeline. Fully customizable.
	
- Rendering pipeline stages

	Front-end vs. Back-end
	
	Front-end (vertex processing): Vertex fetching/pulling (FF); Vertex shader; Tessellation (Tessellation Control shader + Tessellation Engine (FF) + Tessellation Evaluation shader); Geometry shader.
	Vertex post-processing stage (FF): Primitive assembly; Clipping; Viewport transformation; Culling; Rasterization.
	Back-end (fragment processing): Fragment shader; Framebuffer operations and testing (FF); Pixel operations; Compute shader.
	
	Vertex fetching/pulling: Provide (automatically) inputs to the vertex shader.
	Tessellation control shader: Calculate (LOD: Level of Detail) tessellation level (inner and outer) to be input into the tessellation engine and define data to be passed to the tessellation evaluation shader.
	Tessellation engine: Generate new vertices based on specified tessellation levels.
	Tessellation evaluation shader: Calculate position (and others) for newly generated vertices.
	Geometry shader: Create/Discard geometry.
	
	Primitive assembly: Grouping of vertices into points (trivial), lines and triangles, i.e. primitives.
	Clipping: Determine potentially visible primitives (or which part of them). Occurs in Cartesian space (not in Clipping space; perspective division required). Results in normalized device coordinates (NDC; from -1.0 to 1.0 in x and y dimensions; from 0.0 to 1.0 in z dimension).
	Viewport transformation: Place geometry in the window (or viewport). Results in window coordinates (from (0, 0) - usually bottom left - to (width - 1, height - 1); Not pixels!!!).
	Culling: Determine whether the triangle faces toward (front-facing) or away (back-facing) from the viewer and discard desired.
	Rasterization: Determine which pixels are covered by the primitive (half-space based method for triangles). Fragment (need to be colored) generation.
	
	Fragment shader: Determine the color of each fragment.
	Framebuffer operations: xxx
	Pixel operations: xxx
	Compute shader: xxx
	
- Vertex attribute

	An input variable to the vertex shader, i.e. input to the OpenGL graphics pipeline.
	It is how vertex data is introduced into the OpenGL pipeline.

- Barycentric Coordinates Interpolation

	Interpolate vertex data across the triangle's surface.

- Homogeneous coordinte system

	Used in projective geometry (four-component variables); Here, math is simpler than in regular Cartesian space (three-component variables).

- Perspective division

	Transformation (divide all four components of the position by the last, w component) from homogeneous coordinates (or homogeneous space) to Cartesian coordinates (or Cartesian space).
	Results in normalized device coordinates (or normalized device space).
	
- Fragment

	An element that may ultimately contribute to the final color of a pixel.
